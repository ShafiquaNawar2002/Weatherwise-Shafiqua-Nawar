# Weather Advisor App

A minimal Python project scaffold extracted from `weatheradvisor_app.zip`.

> **Current contents:** a single script `weatherapp.py` that prints "Hello".  
> This README, `.gitignore`, and `requirements.txt` are provided so you can expand this into a proper project.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1) Clone or unzip this project
cd weatheradvisor_app

# 2) (Recommended) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3) Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4) Run the app
python weatherapp.py
```

> If your app later uses packages like `requests`, `matplotlib`, `flask`, or `pyinputplus`, add them to `requirements.txt` and reinstall.

## Project Structure

```
weatheradvisor_app/
├─ weatherapp.py        # entry point (currently prints "Hello")
├─ .gitignore           # ignores venvs, caches, OS files, etc.
├─ README.md            # this file
└─ requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
```

---

## Developing

- Keep local virtual environments in `.venv/` (already ignored by `.gitignore`).
- Add new modules and packages as needed.
- Pin your dependencies in `requirements.txt` for reproducible installs.
